## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
- This challenge helped my greatly in understanding the usage of position properties in CSS, also i was able to play around with psuedo-selectors thereby reducing the abuse of class selector usage.
- I also learnt the animation feature which would be important in future project


### Continued development
- I would like to improve on the transform properties in the CSS


### Useful resources
