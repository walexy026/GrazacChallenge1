## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
This challenge helped my greatly in understanding the usage of position properties in CSS, also i was able to play around with psuedo-selectors thereby reducing the abuse of class selector usage.
I also learnt the animation feature which would be important in future project
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


### Continued development
I would like to improve on the transform properties in the CSS


### Useful resources
W3schools - It served as a reference point  for me whenever I'm stucked
Youtube videos on Flexbox,Animation
